SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

NOTICE:
========
You didn't include file headers to specify how to build the programs.
This was a requirement which was stated several times verbally in class.
You were supposed to include three lines of header:
   what platform you used mac, windows, etc
   the command[s] to compile/assemble your code
   the command[s] to link your code to make the program
For the programs that I have had to 'monkey around with' you will lose
   some points.  You will lose even more points if I'm unable to get
   the program to compile/link/run correctly even with my changes.

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   had to change from _start to _main
   also get no output when running the program
   did the best I could with what you gave me

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   had to insert underscore in front of function name
   then program runs fine

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   works as advertised

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   works as advertised

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   changed to winsock2.h to compile makeNBOC.c on windows
   makeNBOC.c compiles fine
   makeNBOCtest.c compiles fine
   can't get program to link on windows

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   your code has mixed up 32-bit and 64-bit addressing so it won't work
   it won't compile at all on windows 32-bit
   You *DO* have your assembly program call your "C" function

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   Homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   Homework02  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   Homework03  104.22% of  5 points =  5.20 points
   Homework04   94.44% of  5 points =  4.72 points
   Homework05   98.00% of 10 points =  9.80 points
   homework06   89.14% of 15 points = 12.62 points
                      semester total: 42.34 out of 45.00 = 94.09%
                             which is an A

Great work!  It's been wonderful having you three in class this semester!
Best wishes for a great holiday break and I look forward to seeing you all
around campus in the spring!
