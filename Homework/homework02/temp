1. What is a computer system?
A set of layers that work off of the ones under them. Different hardware and software components that work together to make a computer function

2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
Motherboards and circuits in the digital logic layer

3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?
The difference is when they convert. A compiled language converts all the source code to machine code before the program runs, an intepreted language does it line by line as it's running (https://unstop.com/blog/difference-between-compiler-and-interpreter#:~:text=The%20major%20difference%20between%20the,line%2C%20as%20it's%20being%20run.)

4. Is C a compiled language?

9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?
ls

10. What does the C function atof() do?
It turns the string representation of a number into the value

11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
The bottom layer, digital logic, is the hardware that the computer operations are run on. It includes the motherboards and all the ciruitry
The next layer is the control layer, which has the microcode. The microcode uses the hardware


12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
1. Fetch 
2. Decode 
3. Execute 


13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
It performs the all the math and bitwise operations on integers using operands.

14. What is a register?


15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?


16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?


17.How many buses are included in the system bus?
3. Data, address and control
